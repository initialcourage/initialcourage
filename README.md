# Terminalangst's archival account.

Hiya, I'm known as Initialcourage on this account, Terminalangst on my main one.
I worked on Analog Funkin' (Coded Archived and Invective), and 30MAY (Everything and Menu Music.)

# Entire reason of this account is to archive my fnf shit, since I've left the community, I'm still on two remaining mods as of typing this.
